# **1. Flipkart_webscraper.ipynb**
In this code I made a webscraper for flipkart to extract the data from flipkart website.
I exctracted the laptop data such as laptop name, ram, hdd, os, screen size, and price.
However the code may not function in future because when websites got updated thier Html format like class name got chnaged.

So all you need to do is change the class name only and it will hardly takes 2 minutes. 
and after that the you should run the code and you will get the final file in csv format containg all the details.
