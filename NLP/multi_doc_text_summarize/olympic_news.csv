2,Neeraj Chopra: 5 Investment Lessons to Learn from India's Olympic Gold Medallist,"Neeraj Chopra, a name that has rung clear across India as well as the international sporting community. Hailing from Khandra, Haryana, this Javelin-throwing Olympian and track-runner brought home the gold for India in August. The Tokyo Olympics did shine a light on this rare gem of an athlete and brought the nation to the forefront thanks to Chopra. As of August 2021, he has been ranked the number two athlete in the world by the World Athletics organisation. He is also the first track runner and field athlete to win a gold medal for India at the Olympics. Here are a few investment lessons one can learn from the sports star.

1) Starting the Journey Early

Chopra started training at the young age of 12. He started training at Panipat Stadium during his free days to lose the extra pounds and shape up for sports. This put him on the path to becoming an Olympian.

Similarly, when it comes to investment, it always helps to start as early as possible. Though in the initial days you may not see much in terms of returns, persistence and time will help you reap the rewards of higher returns. Much like how Chopra started training early so he could achieve his dreams of becoming an athlete, you have to start investing early to reach that goal of financial security.

2) Do Your Due Diligence 

In 2013, Chopra had participated in the IAAF World Youth Championships which were played in Donetsk, Ukraine. He failed to qualify for that tournament as he finished in 19th place. However, he managed to get the season’s best throw of 66.75 metres. Over time, he gradually improved his performance and in the 2015 Asian Athletics Championships in Wuhan, China he went up a step to 9th place. Gradually he mastered all the necessary skills to be the best at the game.

Before investing your money and expecting exorbitant returns, you should pace yourself. Make sure that you have a proper plan for the amount of returns you are expecting from the investment and how you are planning to reach there. It also helps to know what you want your money to do for you down the road, so define the goal.

3) Coaching and Learning

Young Chopra was not always as enthusiastic about sports as he is today. However, over time he built up his fondness and drive. Over the years he has trained under many coaches and fitness experts to get his game on point. This guidance is one of the major reasons why he has become such an athlete.

Much like Chopra, investors will need guidance and help in the market. It always helps to follow the expert’s lead in these matters. Consulting fund managers and stock brokers will help create a plan or a guide to your investment goal.

4) Small Setbacks and Comebacks

In 2018 Chopra suffered a serious elbow injury that resulted in him having to undergo elbow surgery. This put him out of commission for the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships. He trained hard and made his comeback, eventually going on to win gold at the Tokyo Olympics.

The market is volatile and that won’t change. But if you are focussed and do your homework, a bad day at the stock market should not bother you. Start slow and set your performance expectations at a realistic level. Be confident about your strength and skills, you will also weather any storm like our ‘Golden Boy’.

5) Stay Updated, Upgrade yourself

Chopra is constantly posting on his social media on the various kinds of exercises he does outside of big events to get ready for them. From diet to fitness routine, he is always up-to-date with the modern techniques to stay at the top of his game. Similarly, investors need to stay updated with the latest norms of the market and investments and upgrade accordingly.

Investors need to be able to think on their feet. Maybe you invested too much or you are locked into a year-end tax saver fund scheme. Whatever the case, appreciate the game for what it is and learn for the future from your mistakes. Keep learning on multiple venues and grow them parallelly if you want to be a successful investor.",https://www.news18.com/news/business/neeraj-chopra-top-5-investment-lessons-to-learn-from-indias-olympic-gold-medallist-4098734.html
3,"18k followers, Olympic medal: Sindhu’s coach Park’s India takeaways","Last month when PV Sindhu’s South Korean coach Park Tae Sang boarded the flight for Tokyo Games, he was a social media nobody with a mere 328 Instagram followers. Within days of Sindhu winning the historic bronze, Park’s phone had a notification overload.

“Oh, it’s crazy, crazy, crazy! Just a second,” he says before pulling out his phone to show the current count of close to 18,000, majority of them being Indians. So used to seeing national coach P Gopichand on the sidelines for significant games, India wanted to know about the calm coach with a serene smile.

The new-found fame in a foreign land has come at a cost and is a result of a tough decision he took. Taking up this pandemic-time assignment meant Park has been away from his young family for a long time.

“My 4-year-old daughter (Soyu) would call me every day and say, ‘Papa when are you coming home? I felt very sad at times. After the pandemic, it was very tough for me and Sindhu. For almost two months we could not practice. But as soon as the cases went a little down we started practice and I decided to not go to Korea because it would further affect her training,” he says.

PV Sindhu’s coach Park Tae Sang, who has met his family for just 13 days since February last year, shows a picture of his daughter Soyu. (Andrew Amsan)
“Since last February I have met my family for 13 days. One-three, not three-zero,” says the 42-year-old coach.

Before he landed in India, Park had to take a major call. In retrospect he feels it was one of the best decisions he has taken.

After resigning as South Korea’s national coach, Park received a call from his alma mater, Dongeui University, to train juniors. But that was also the time he got an unexpected text message from the Indians to train the men’s singles players.

Park knew it would be a demanding job but he had an unfulfilled dream that the comfortable university job close to home would not fulfil — winning an Olympic medal. Adjusting to India too took some time. Initially, Park was staying at a Korean guest house in Hyderabad and found food suited his taste buds. But since they shut shop during the pandemic, Park had to rent an apartment and do his own cooking.

“I miss Korean food. But I like Indian food too. Butter chicken, stir-fried chicken, tandoori chicken, paneer, dosa and lassi drink are my favourites.”

Even before he joined Indian badminton, Park knew what he was signing for. As a player, Park, a 2002 Asian Games gold medallist, missed out on a bronze in the 2004 Athens Olympics.

As a coach two of his students faltered at the quarterfinals of the mega event. India was his chance at redemption. “This is a dream come true for me. I cried a little bit when Sindhu won. Just a little bit. When I was a player I lost in the quarterfinals at the Athens Olympics. After that I switched to coaching my two women’s singles players from Korea but they lost in quarterfinals,” says Park.

But dreams of Olympic proportions take a lot of effort.

Shoring up defence

And in Sindhu’s case, team effort. Park had observed the Rio silver medallist’s game closely and felt her defence needed massive improvement to stand any chance of winning consecutive medals.

Park uses google translator to express Sindhu’s passion for the game.
It is no secret that Sindhu has a very strong attack. With a lot of tournaments cancelled in the run-up to the Olympics, Park had a lot of time to focus on tightening her defense.

“Sindhu had this habit of making the shuttle contact very low. I always told her if she made contact one centimetre higher that would mean the opponent would have to retrieve a centimetre lower.

“It’s important to catch more height. We would sometimes get two or three men’s singles players to hit drop shots at Sindhu and I would ask her to return it from a higher position. It allows you to finish off the point in the next shot. I teach the juniors the same thing, it is very very important,” explains the master tactician, almost ready to jump off his seat to show it in action.

Although Sindhu has shown a “200 per cent improvement” in her defence since the Worlds she was outwitted by the deceptive Tai Tzu Ying of Chinese Taipei in the semifinals. “Her defence against Tai Tzu was not good enough so there was no connect or attack. I told her you have to sometimes do a deceptive drop shot when in such a position. The same as what Tai Tzu does,” says coach Park.

Although things did not go as per plan against world-class Tai Tzu, Park says the journey with his diligent student will continue. He is struggling with English words to convey Sindhu’s eagerness to train. After a point he gives up, he reaches for the phone and looks for google translation app. His fingers runs on the keys and he looks up with a smile as he holds up the phone. “She is greedy about badminton” – flashes on the screen and Park gives a nod",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/18k-followers-olympic-medal-sindhus-coach-parks-india-takeaways-7458738/
4,Modi’s hard work behind youths winning medals at Olympics: Devusinh Chauhan,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s hard work of four to five years was behind youths like Neeraj Chopra getting gold medal in Olympics, Union Minister of State for Communications Devusinh Chauhan said on Tuesday.

Chauhan was addressing a public gathering in Patan of North Gujarat during the second day of his Jan Ashirvad Yatra in the region.

As per the suggestion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, various ministers in the Union Cabinet who have been inducted into the council of ministers recently started Jan Ashirvad Yatra, seeking blessings of the people.

Devusinh, who is a Lok Sabha MP from Kheda constituency, has started his three-day yatra in North Gujarat from August 16. He started his second day of the yatra from Patan on Tuesday, where he also addressed a public gathering.

Crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for various decisions, some of which he called as “unprecedented”, Chauhan said, “If a woman player (from India) is bringing a medal or a youth like Neeraj Chopra is winning gold (at Olympics)…, then Modi saheb’s hardwork of 4-5 years is behind these players.”



Chauhan also credited Modi for inducting 27 persons from the Other Backward Class (OBC) communities in the recently expanded union council of ministers. He said that people from poor communities, who have become MPs have been made ministers, would never have imagined that they will function as minister in the Indian government. Chauhan added that PM Modi has appointed many like him from backward communities as ministers while giving them an opportunity to work.

In another rally at Idar of Sabarkantha district, Chauhan referred to the felicitation he received from the locals and said that he considered it as felicitation of PM Modi and of the ideology of BJP.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/narendra-modi-hard-work-behind-youths-winning-medals-at-olympics-devusinh-chauhan-7458534/
5,What next for Indian hockey after the historic high of the Tokyo Olympics? Harendra Singh on the potential road ahead,"NEW DELHI: Planning holds the key when it comes to building on a successful result. Indian hockey's return to the Olympic podium has come after 41 years. Now it's important that this climb back up, which took four decades, doesn't stop here.
The last decade and a bit of those 41 years has been the most crucial. A professional approach by Hockey India led to historic success -- be it the bronze-medal effort at the junior women's World Cup in 2013 or the title victory in the 2016 junior men's World Cup. More importantly, those milestones were not just left behind but built on.
The senior women went on to qualify for two consecutive Olympics in 2016 and 2020/21 and marked Tokyo with its first ever semifinal appearance at the Games. The men went a step ahead and reclaimed their storied place on the Olympic podium with a bronze medal in Tokyo.
What India does from hereon might determine the success of the ascent leading up to the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Former India coach Harendra Singh, who mentored both the men's and women's national teams before taking up his current assignment as coach of USA men, believes the foundation needs to be made stronger and the sport's visibility must improve to inspire the younger generation.

Excerpts from an interview with TimesofIndia.com...
The Indian hockey teams had their best show at the Olympics since the 1980 men's gold medal. If you go back to before the Tokyo Games began, will you be satisfied with the result?
Any team or player, when he or she enters an Olympic competition, has just one thing in mind: 'I want to win a medal'. Our men and women hockey teams went in with the same mindset. They went with high hopes, which was reasonable as well. The way both the teams have played over the last 4-5 years, it was reasonable.
Especially the women, I must say. From No. 9, to break into the top 5 or 6 is very tough, but not impossible. I think it must be for the first time in history that a team lost its first three matches (at the Olympics) and still stayed in the race for a podium finish. It shows the (women's) team's determination, hunger and never-say-die attitude. They conceded, came back, equalised, then won. And to beat a top team (Australia) in the quarters, who had demolished everyone in the pool stage, it defines mindset.
In the semis, we lost a very close match (1-2) to Argentina. Then in the bronze-medal match, being down 1-3 against Rio Olympics gold medallists (Great Britain), the way (drag-flicker) Gurjit Kaur came back after the first three defeats, she brought India to a position where we almost won a bronze. It was a statement made by the team. Many people had raised questions about Gurjit (after poor form in pool games). I had said then that this girl is a tournament winner.

How much does the men's bronze medal mean to you on a personal level? We saw you get emotional while on live broadcast after the win...
Hockey is connected to Indian hearts. Emotionally, it was for me personally a moment of satisfaction, which I will cherish for a lifetime. Since 1998 (when he started coaching), whenever I would step onto the field, I would always tell the players that my dream is to see an Olympic medal hanging from your neck, irrespective of the colour. The bitter memories of the 2000 Sydney Olympics (India conceded in the last two minutes against Poland to miss out on the semis), the recordings of which I still have with me, were erased with this medal. Some one like Dhanraj Pillay is still especially hurt by the thoughts of that day. These boys (current men's team) have ended that pain.
So many stories of sacrifices surface after such a success...
The story of each and every individual in this team, be it the men or women, is so inspiring. You talk about Neha (Goyal), who had an abusive father and picked up the hockey stick to escape that horror. Talk about Nisha (Warsi), Navjot (Kaur), Navneet (Kaur), Savita Punia. In 2017, when I talked to the girls about their past, I was shocked to know that Savita didn't have a job.

I could relate to all this because I came from a background where my whole family used to live in a 7x8 room. When the power would go off at 8 pm every day, we would go to the Talkatora Indoor Stadium to study. When I listened to the stories of these players, I thought my hardship is nothing compared to theirs. After this medal, even if I die the next moment now, I would die in peace.
A very common question from the new hockey fans is why most players come from the villages. What would be your answer that?
Not just hockey, but any sport that requires physical and mental toughness for skill (prospers in the villages)...Generally only that kid takes up hockey who knows the value of small things in life. This is not just now, but right from 1928. The elite class very rarely played hockey. There were exceptions like the families of Aslam Sher Khan. But most who played, be it the pre- or post-independence era in India, were only those who valued little things. And physically hockey is such a demanding sport that those who are not mentally prepared for the toil, they leave it midway. To dedicate his life to India, every village kid can step up, whether it is in the form of a farmer, in the armed forces or as an Olympian.

Will the Tokyo success inspire youngsters in Tier-1 cities as well?
I think they (kids in larger cities) will get inspired. After this medal, the role of everyone becomes very important. If we want to make hockey a sport for the elite as well, we have to bring the game back at the school level. We are doing it at academies and clubs, that's fine. But the sport has to find its feet once again at the school level, even if on a small field, five-a-side game.
To bring hockey back at the school level, the role of state associations and governments is going to be very important. For example, local hockey in Delhi has almost died...
My birthplace is Bihar and my workplaces have been Delhi and Mumbai. I cry when I see the state of hockey in Delhi now and from the time in the past. At the iconic Shivaji Stadium ground, to get a glimpse of players like Vineet Kumar, Rajinder Singh, Sukhdev Singh, Ashok Diwan, Ashok Kumar, we would sit outside the stadium for hours. And then hope that we get to play for a few minutes on the pitch.
Today the game's state is such that there are five astro-turfs in Delhi, but the state doesn't have even five players in the senior national core groups. It's a sad state of affairs.
We failed when we let school hockey die and the school teams vanished...Until hockey returns to schools, it will remain limited to a few areas. Academies are running, that's fine. But what happens is that they would beat any leftover school teams with 15-16 goal margins. Earlier there were teams like Union Academy School, Modern School, Ghumanhera, CRZ Sonepat (all in Delhi). All of them used to participate and there was an even contest. But now, say if there is one academy in the entire state, it would thrash any local team. When that happens, the schools shut down their teams and as a result, school tournaments vanish.

Do you think the parents also need to step up and motivate kids?
When the parents and children both get involved, only then sports come up. Who will bring the kid to the ground? The parents. Why not arrange weekend tournaments at the National Stadium or Shivaji Stadium?
Kids generally get inspired by what they see. Something like cricket is on TV channels almost throughout the year, even recorded matches. That plays a part in creating heroes. But the same doesn't happen with a sport like hockey. Could that be one of the reasons for the sport lagging behind?
This question is for the entire fraternity, including the players, federations and media. Any sports broadcaster should take this as a responsibility to show the old hockey matches as well, in fact for all Olympic sports. There is this hype of 15 days around the Olympics, but soon we will start watching Premier League and cricket, but there will be no sign of hockey.
I would urge the broadcasters to also show matches of other sports regularly. Cricket and football is on TV the entire year. Kids watch it and pick up from that. Hockey is only live when any big tournament is being played. The regularity of sport's visibility is not there. If you say hockey is not popular now, then the responsibility to change that lies with all of us.

Coming back to the Tokyo Olympic success, the role of grassroot coaches -- who created players like Manpreet Singh and Rani Rampal -- has been underplayed. Would you like to urge the authorities to honour them as well?
When I got the Dronacharya Award, I made a statement at that time and would want to say it again: The Dronacharya Award should actually be for the grassroot coaches. Those who work with the national team get fame because the team wins. But who actually was Guru Dronacharya? The Guru who trained the Kauravas and the Pandavas. The likes of Arjuna knew nothing, but Guru Drona trained him. And then under the leadership of Krishna, they (Pandavas) won the battle of Mahabharata. But we remember Krishna more than Guru Dronacharya.
So this award should be for the coaches who identified the talent in a player to become an international star. Their contribution is more important. I can still return my Dronacharya Award if it can be given to one of the grassroot-level coaches. Be it Avtar Singh coach saab (Surjit Hockey Academy), Kalu Charan Chaudhary (Odisha) and others. They are the unsung heroes.
I used to call them and take players from them to train for the (2016) junior World Cup. These coaches find the players, prepare them and then they come to us for fine-tuning. But sadly, no one remembers the person who discovered the gold, only the goldsmith is remembered.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/what-next-for-indian-hockey-after-the-historic-high-of-the-tokyo-olympics-harendra-singh-on-the-potential-road-ahead/articleshow/85363546.cms

7,"A sports culture beyond Olympics: To find lasting success, India needs to start at the very bottom","India’s campaign at the Tokyo Olympics was a story of two weeks.

Even though weightlifter Mirabai Chanu opened the country’s account with a silver on the very first day of competition, the opening week was largely about the struggles of the fancied shooters to win medals after arriving in Japan as contenders. And the usual question about why a country with over a billion people can’t win medals at the Olympics began to rear its head on various forums.

The second week started with medals from boxer Lovlina Borgohain and shuttler PV Sindhu, then the men’s hockey team won their first medal in 41 years. Soon, wrestlers finished on the podium for the fourth straight Games. Then, Neeraj Chopra provided the icing on the cake with the country’s second individual gold and the first in track and field by hurling the javelin to 87.58m to end India’s campaign on a high. As if by magic, the questions vanished.

Some experts were quick to term the country’s best-ever performance in the Olympic Games as a potential gamechanger that can help build the much-talked about sports culture and lay the foundation for India to produce many more champions in the future.

If only it was as simple as winning a couple of medals to turn the tide.

There is no doubt that a medal, especially like the one won by Chopra, can make many more youngsters take up a sport and aspire to emulate the champion. But building a sports culture and a subsequent legacy of champions requires much more dedication and a change in approach from all stakeholders.

It is common knowledge that the tried and tested system of consistently producing champion athletes begins with broadening the base of the pyramid and building from there. While everyone involved in India’s sports ecosystem keeps talking about it, the majority of their efforts are concentrated only at the top of the pyramid.

It is not to say that the top athletes do not need financial or scientific support to transform from potential talent to medal-winning individuals. But putting all eggs in one basket isn’t really a fool-proof strategy. The way things are in the Indian sports ecosystem, the top players get support from the government, the various Non-Governmental Organisations determined to help the country win medals on the international stage, and even the corporates.

But if you ask any of these players, they will vouch for the fact that the most difficult part for many of them has been the journey from the district to the national/international stage and then unlearning or relearning everything to start making a mark at the level that matters. It is during this journey that their technical and physical foundation is laid and they need valuable support in building a strong base. And the effort needed during this stage is why probably the idiom “it needs a village to raise a champion” was coined.

And this is where India is nowhere near building a culture that promotes sports as a lifestyle and a viable career option.

Just a few months back when an up-and-coming athlete approached one such high profile foundation for support, the player was told that their research team did not find enough performance data on the national and international stage in the last year. The only problem with the argument is that the said player is around 15 years old and there has been no sporting activity for over a year now. For many such organisations, the players’ potential hardly matters. And this is not an isolated incident.

These organisations have their own challenges to deal with. It’s difficult for them to raise money unless they have top players on their roster because the corporate world that funds them is looking for their Return on Investment. Even someone like former All England champion Pullela Gopichand struggled to convince these corporate honchos to fund his dream of building an academy just about a decade ago but now has few of them lining up to sign him or his star players after he has proved a point.

One expected this to change after the tax benefits from money invested under Corporate Social Responsibility were extended for sports initiatives as well. This has definitely helped NGOs looking after top athletes to raise funds. But the grassroot areas are still not getting the benefits.

I have been associated with a few NGOs who have been working diligently in helping young Indian players make it big on the international stage. The players get the required monetary support for tournaments, hiring sports science experts and other facilities.

But these organisations do not consider investing in creating a system around the coach who is nurturing these talented youngsters by teaching them the basics and bringing them to the national level. In fact, most of them don’t even think it’s important to pay these coaches for the services they have rendered or provide the basic necessary equipment to the centre that can help more players than just the ones they are supporting.

Among the top corporates in India, the Tatas were the first to invest at the grassroots level in sports and now Reliance Foundation and JSW have taken further steps in encouraging grassroots sports with the latter even building a state-of-art training centre in Vijayanagar in Karnataka. The Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences in Odisha and the Rural Development Trust in Anantpur have been doing their bit in promoting sports in the region.

Many other NGOs have been using sports as a vehicle for social change in rural India but that is just an add-on to their overall outreach program and not really an attempt to nurture sporting talent.

While what the big corporate and these NGOs are doing is laudable, the centralised system isn’t enough for a country as vast and as diverse as India. If one studies the model of any of the top sporting nations in the world, it is the schools, local clubs and community centres that lay the foundation for proper coaching and support to young players with businesses and philanthropists in the vicinity funding the initiatives.

In India, we want the governments to invest in grassroots and the ambitious Khel India scheme has been launched for the same while the corporate and other stakeholders prefer to jump on the bandwagon once the success stories have already begun. But that is too much to ask. The ideal situation is the government or local bodies build the infrastructure required or provide aid for the same to educational institutions while the local community helps sustain the initiative and build a proper system for training and development.

The one example that comes to mind is that of the coaching centre of reigning national women’s wrestling champion Nandini Salokhe. The company that started giving her stipend as part of their CSR initiative six years ago also hired a strength and conditioning expert and helped build a gymnasium in the Murgud village near Kolhapur. The system helped the coach produce at least half a dozen national-level medallists in the last two years and many more are in the pipeline.

The gym facility in the premises became a boon for Salokhe herself when her Anterior Cruciate Ligament tore during competition in 2019. She could complete her rehab after surgery in her own village instead of making the over 100-kilometre commute every day from Murgud to Kolhapur and back for strength training.

The respective sports federations also need to invest in training the coaches in sports science and psychology as they are the ones hand-holding young kids and teaching them the nuances of the sport.

They are also the first point of contact between a child and a sport, and a proper talent identification process at that level could go a long way in helping talented youngsters win more medals on the international stage.

It is a fact that almost 90-95% of the talent that gets the support of the government or the NGOs currently working in this space is self-driven or plain lucky as there is no real mechanism to identify them at an early age.

There is a need for extensive testing in rural and tribal areas of the country to formulate physical parameters of young children according to Indian standards and then help them pick the right sport to make a career in.

But more importantly to just build a sports culture we need to promote physical literacy and awareness about playing sport with the right technical knowledge without thinking of the rewards in terms of medals and success.

Anyone who has been to European countries that are dominant in the world of sports can attest that the basic standard of play even among recreational players is quite high. Most of them may not go on to make a career in sport but are taught the basics of the sport in the right manner in school or by community elders. In fact, playing and watching sports is part of their social life.

I have come across many parents who complain about their kids being addicted to the screen. But none of them had ever tried to introduce their children to play a sport and the argument most of the time is they aren’t going to make a career out of it, so why bother.

One wonders how do they know? Someone like Chopra came to the athletics ground because his family members felt that he needed some activity to lose weight. It’s a different matter that he is the pride of the nation now.

It’s been a week since curtains were drawn on the Tokyo Olympics. The corporate world has jumped on the bandwagon of publicity to announce prizes to the medal winners or those who were close to winning one.

The euphoria will soon die down and we will probably again oscillate between the emotions mentioned at the start of this article depending on how the results pan out at 2024 Paris Olympics.

And even if our elite athletes manage to improve on their Tokyo showing in Paris three years from now, we can’t boast of a sports culture unless we start at the very bottom and work upwards",https://scroll.in/field/1002882/olympics-and-sports-culture-to-find-lasting-success-india-needs-to-start-at-the-bottom

9,"Post Olympics, have brands managed to change India's sports narrative?","After an unparalleled performance at the Tokyo Olympics 2020, Indian sportspersons have helped not only catapult India’s sports image at the world stage but also given the perfect opportunity to brands and advertisers to associate with the Indian contingent.

Brands forming associations with sports is not new but the relationship has been further strengthened after India's stellar performance at the Tokyo Olympics. In the wake of the games, a host of brands went all out undeterred by the Covid challenges, from representing athletes to curating special campaigns. Such endeavours have steered conversations around sports in the country.

Mia by Tanishq announced its association with three female athletes representing India at Tokyo. The brand also extended support to the athletes by partnering with Manika Batra, Deepika Kumari, Pooja Rani, Navjot Kaur and Rani Rampal at the Olympics for its latest campaign ‘#ShareTheShine.' Speaking on how conversations change perceptions, Shymala Ramanan, Business Head, Mia by Tanishq said, “Conversations are the best tools to influence and change people’s perceptions. Our objective with this particular campaign was to get people talking about the athletes, especially the real humans behind all the grit and the glory that we see on field. What we discovered was that behind every World No 1 player or Olympics super performer is a regular girl who has dreams, aspirations and a unique sense of style like a true Mia woman. Our conversations with Manika and Deepika were absolutely delightful and showed a different side of them. If this gets people talking about them, our job here is done.”

Ranjivjit Singh, CMO, Hero Motocorp also believes that constant conversations with customers is absolutely imperative for any brand, and it becomes even more rewarding when it involves Gen Z and the millenials. 

One of the Co-presenting sponsors for the official broadcast of Tokyo Olympics, MPL also came up their #FanBannJaaoge campaign where it shed spotlight on athletes and their many achievements, and in doing so, get the entire nation to rally behind them. It also created the first ever Indian Olympic Fan Army which received a groundswell of support from MPL users and top sports teams.  

“It’s an honour for MPL Sports Foundation to partner with the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and cheer on our talented athletes as they make India proud. The athletes who have represented us are some of the best in the world and have achieved significant milestones, but they are not as celebrated as they deserve to be. We are now 100 million-strong and growing. Our aim is to reach each and every Indian, and inspire them to become fans of the Indian contingent, not just during the current Olympics but in the future as well,” said Sai Srinivas, Trustee, MPL Sports Foundation and Co-Founder and CEO, MPL.

N Chandramouli, CEO, TRA stated that fluid conversations around a topic increase interest area of people. He added, “The time of a conversation plays a crucial role in strengthening its impact and permissibility. This is the right time to have conversations around sports after spectacular performance of our Indian contingent at the Tokyo Olympics 2020.”

However, we need to have more conversations around sports and sportspersons, asserted Chandramouli.

Cricket has always attracted the major share in the pie chart of brands associating with sports but now the tables have started turning around. Sporting events like the Tokyo Olympics, aside from being media blitzkriegs are also opportunities for brands like to stand for something apart from purely functional benefits. “It's a matter of great pride to be able to partner with athletes from the Indian contingent. This was also our chance to break the clutter in the Indian jewellery industry advertising space and create a unique positioning. The amount of media coverage the Mia #ShareTheShine campaign is receiving on a daily basis is a testament to the same”, added Ramanan.

“We at Hero MotoCorp have always believed in the power of sports in shaping the future of the youth of the country. It is immensely gratifying to see youngsters and budding sporting talent from small towns and hinterland of India making a mark on the national and international stage, thanks to our continued support to various sports such as hockey, football, golf and cricket”, noted Singh.

Chandramouli noted that this is a win-win opportunity for both brands as well as sportspersons. While brands get the confidence to put in their money on the sportsperson along with the players becoming a popular household name.

In the past few years, the sports scenario in India has definitely changed for the better. The interest levels,  awareness and recall of the Indian athletes participating in the Olympics are at an all-time high. The social media conversations, post analyses as well as brand sponsorships reflect the same. “Sports is a soft narrative and so is life. When brands support sports, they support this soft narrative. This can only be good for brands. You will therefore see deeper brand involvement in sports,” pointed  Harish Bijoor, Brand Guru & Founder, Harish Bijoor Consults Inc.

When talking about brand associations, one should also take into consideration of the thin line between being opportunistic of the moment and long term associations. In this age of moment marketing and situational intervention, it is necessary for brands to take a look at a bigger picture rather than on just that moment. Experts opine that sportspersons should be supported from the grassroots level to be part of their journey and not only when they win laurels for the country. Through this approach, brands as well as the government should look at the larger perspective and therefore, will be able to locate young talent, affirmed Chandramouli.

Singh also feels that it is extremely important for brands and corporates to keep supporting sports for the long term for our sportspersons to really be able to succeed in the global arena. “As I said earlier, we at Hero MotoCorp have remained commited to the promotion of sports for more than a couple of decades now. This is the kind of genuine commitment which is required for the sports culture in the country to flourish. At the same time, no moment is small enough to celebrate. Every success of our sportspersons has to be cheered and has to be celebrated”, added Singh.

While Ramanan was of a different opinion. According to him, “It is crucial that we get people talking about larger agendas with the bigger picture in mind but at the same time, for sports events like the Olympics, it is very important to celebrate every victory, every achievement and every step that our athletes take forward. For while in our industry it may be termed as 'moment marketing', each of those little moments is actually the culmination of years of hard work, discipline and sheer grit. So 'moment marketing' is actually a celebration of many moments adding upto that single one.”

The Olympic fever doesn’t seem to have faded away as yet. Brands continue to laud the Indian players, who not only won but also to those players who performed exceedingly well at the mega sporting event. Tata Motors recently announced that the company will be felicitating Indian athletes who narrowly missed the bronze medal in the recently held Tokyo Olympics. To thank and recognize these homegrown players for their sheer hard work and dedication, Tata Motors will be delivering its most premium hatch, the Altroz, in the High Street Gold colour, to these players soon.

Shailesh Chandra, President, Passenger Vehicle Business, Tata Motors said, “For India, this Olympics was about a lot more than medals and podium finishes. We are fortunate to celebrate the effort and spirit of our athletes representing our country, competing under the highest pressure against the absolute best talent the world has to offer and coming extremely close to a podium finish. They might have missed a medal but they have won the hearts of millions of Indians, with their dedication and are a true inspiration for budding athletes in India. As the leading homegrown automotive brand, we truly understand the spirit of ‘Dare to Dream and Achieve’, as it is a culture that drives us in Tata Motors as well. The Tata Altroz has set new benchmarks in its segment by achieving the Gold standard in Safety, Design and Performance. It is our privilege to honour the spirit of these path breakers and present them a small token that signifies the Gold Standard, the Altroz.”",https://www.exchange4media.com/pr-and-corporate-communication-news/post-olympics-have-brands-managed-to-change-indias-sports-narrative-115026.html
